# tuneapp

An Android app for giving feedback how accurately you stay in tune when you sing or play an instrument. Suitable for anyone who thinks their "musical ear" might need some help or training.

#Features
The app shows in a great way, how the user has deviated from the intended tune, by

1) displaying notes separately, so that user can review, how he deviated during each individual note. A separate note is defined as a sound whose frequency is consistently in the (-50cent;+50cent) range from the expected note;

2) showing the user an alert when they have deviated more than a predefined value from the key the song was started in;

3) showing, using a color, how the user has deviated from the key the song started in. A color is visually easier to perceive than numeric or needle-based indicators
